# CI workflow (GitHub Actions)
# What this does:
# - Runs automatically on every Pull Request to main, and on pushes to non-main branches.
# - Executes the Python unit tests (standard library unittest) for the drafts-checker tooling.
# Why it exists:
# - Provides fast feedback ("Checks" in the PR) so we only merge changes that pass tests.
# Notes:
# - This workflow does NOT deploy the website. Deployment to GitHub Pages is handled separately
#   by .github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml, which runs only after merging to main.
